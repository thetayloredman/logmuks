    authorization code redirect login is supported in some limited cases.
* Added rendering for polls.
* Added power level changer in user info panel.
* Added default aspect ratio for custom emojis to avoid timeline jumping when
  lots of them are loaded.

# v26.06

  * Linux builds now have an actually usable browser engine,
    and macOS builds are signed to allow installing without workarounds.

    multiple backends at once. Extra backends have to be added manually for now,
    management UI will be added later.
* Added message search panel.

  wrapper.

* Added support for sending per-message profiles with [MSC4461].
* Changed resyncing state to detect the user being state reset out of the room
  even if the request doesn't fail (e.g. due to the room being world-readable).

### Web
* Added support for reading stable [MSC2545] event types.
* Added support for per-room notification sounds.
* Added option to force sending an attachment as a file.

  (allows ordered lists where the indexes jump arbitrarily).

  plain room links/aliases.
* Fixed SSO login not working if the homeserver URL had a trailing slash.
* Fixed unicode RTL overrides not being isolated properly in some contexts.

different frontends, like web and terminal. For context, see

the backend in a future release. It's also not at feature parity with legacy
